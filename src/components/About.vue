          I’m Atharva Hinge a Frontend Developer from Maharashtra, India.
          I specialise in designing and building interface designs for mobile and web-based applications with a focus on simplicity & usability.
          I’m passionate about design and technology and how the two can converge to create experiences for good.
           My interest in Technology started back in 2010 when I was a young boy trying to comprehend how the internet works. Ever since then
           I have admired the complexity of the Internet and how much benefit it brings in our day to day life.
